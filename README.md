# UPF-SentimentAnalysis_DeepLearning
The last execution of the files are not correct (we didn't have time to execute them again due to the problem with the UPF accounts).
For example, the LSTM model last execution shows some prints we did in order to get some sizes information which are not relevant for the final result. We stopped the execution and that's why an error appears.
You can execute them in order to see all the correct results.

We uploaded again the files after making a final execution so the results can be directly seen. Therefore, you don't need to run all the code since it takes some time.
